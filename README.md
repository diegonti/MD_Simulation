# Project I : MD Simulation of a VdW Gas

This is the official reposotory for the Advanced Computational Tools master subject final project, from the Atomistic and Multiscale Computational Modelling in Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry master.

The puropose of this project is to develop a serial and pararel version of a Molecular Dynamics simulator of a Lennard-Jones fluid. Therefore, the serial code can be found at the [serial directory](./serial/), and the paralel code at the [paralel directory](./paralel/)

## Installing

This project is designed to be compiled on Unix-type machines (Linux/macOS). The autorhs do not guarantee its correct compilation on Windows machines.

Before starting the compilation, make sure to be using the gfortran compiler, at least version `11.3.0` or greater. Other compilers have not been tested.

For the statistics and visualization scripts the following Python modules are required: `numpy`, `scypy`, `matplotlib`, `ase`. Which can be installed with:
```
$ pip install -r scripts/requeriments.txt
or $ pip install module    (for each module)
```

Once meeting the requirements, `git clone` this repository, and, inside the repo folder, just do `make`. A Makefile script will be interpreted by make, and will compile all the source files.

## Usage

In order to use the simulator, a parameter file must be supplied as a first argument list, such as `./MDEMI.x parameters.nml`. An example of parameter input file can be found at [here](./parameters.nml).

To compile the program use:
``` 
$ make
```
To run the program:
``` 
$ make run_serial
```
Once the progam has finished succesfully, the output files will be created in the parent directory. Then the statistics and visualization can be generated with:
```
$ make postprocess input="name_logfile.log"
```
Which will create an `name_stats.log` in the current directory and the plots (block average and visualization) in the `plots/` (or specified) folder. 

The output folder of the plots and different flags, such as makeing a trajectory GIF or selecting the start and final frame to make the plots and statistichs can be selected adding an additional argument (optional):
```
$ make postprocess input="name_logfile.log" args="-op output_file -s start -f finish -t"
```
If wanted, the plots and visualization can be done separately with:
```
$ make stats input="name_logfile.log" args="-op output_file -s start -f finish"
$ make plots input="name_logfile.log" args="-op output_file -s start -f finish -t"
```

More info about the Python scripts and their flags in [here](https://github.com/diegonti/Project_I/tree/master/scripts).

For general help about the makefile try:
```
$ make help
```
And to clean all the generated compilation files, use:
```
$ make clean
```
